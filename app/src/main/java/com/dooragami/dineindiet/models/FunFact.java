    /*
      this class would describe a fun fact, which can be displayed when starting up the app
      to immediately engage the user in something trivial and possibly entertaining.
      Example: display a small fragment called announcements with a message saying;
       "Yesterday you ate [approximately...] 1,200,000,333 carbon atoms."

      Example 2: msg;
       "That is a new record for you!. #LoggingNutrientsIsLife

      Note that the twitter hashtag might be a sign of being behind-the-times,
      but it does demonstrate that these messages could contain links to campains on
      social media.
